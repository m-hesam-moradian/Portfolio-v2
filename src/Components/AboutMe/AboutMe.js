          <p>
            im a computer science student and web programmer with a lot of
            enthusiasm and determination for learning and developing web
            software. I am looking for job opportunities where I can increase my
            experience and skills in this field. By using online courses such as
            SabzLearn, I have become proficient in CSS, HTML, and JS languages
            and have completed various practice projects using these languages.
            Additionally, I am currently learning JS.React and Bootstrap 5,
            which are popular and widely used frameworks in web programming. I
            enjoy working in a team and can collaborate with different people. I
            am excited to participate in exciting and challenging projects and
            showcase my creativity and innovation.
